## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<img style="float: left;" src="trovador/readme/images/lrm65s.jpg"> Volo is not the only one who knows stories worth telling. There are many troubadours and bards who travel all over Faerûn risking their lives in order to brighten up the taverns we visit.

This mod adds a very special troubadour, who, for a few gold pieces, will tell you unheard stories and even the origins of certain characters, such as the mysterious Riojano, or Artemis Entreri.You can find him in Waukeen Promenade. It also adds a shop with curious objects. Is is available in Spanish only.

<details><summary><ins>Original note from the author</ins></summary>
<p>

###### One night, reading some short stories from REO Clan members, the thought crossed my mind that, among all the mods that populated the net, there was none with the simple goal of telling stories to players. As I had recently learned to handle a bit of WeiDU, lo and behold, I embarked on the task... This is the result, gradually expanded with more ideas and experiments.

<ins>What is version A?</ins>

###### Because I'm a newbie at creating mods, I've included several ideas bit by bit... but various bugs in installations and the like have resulted in parts, objects, or even areas that worked perfectly for me, no longer doing so. However, I could dedicate little time to modding, so the corrections took me a long time... and meanwhile, I get more stories to include in the Troubadour's repertoire, stories that have to wait until I finish corrections...

###### This is why Version A was born: it is the basic Troubadour, only the character, the dialogue, the stories and the store, all of it already tested and working. Little by little, version A will include the improvements of the original mod that have been tested and work perfectly.

<ins>What you will find in the mod</ins>
- A character who, for a few gold pieces, will tell you the most beautiful stories.
- A series of stories about the alter egos of the members of the REO Clan (If you are a member of the REO Clan and you want me to tell your story, send it to me).
- A store with curious, powerful, useful, ironic and forgotten objects.

<ins>Stories included (in order of inclusion)</ins>
- "The Duel" (by Myther)
- "The guardian stars" (by Clak)
- "The Chase" (by Kimmuriel)
- Riojano's Personal History: "Blood of Gods".
- "History and present of the city that united all races" (by Kushtar, Jashir and Tadhik).
- Kimmuriel's Personal History: "Memoirs of a drow".
- Myther's Personal History: "The Light of Hope".
- Khaine's Personal History: "The Arrival".
- Artemis' Personal History: "The Hunt and the Maiden".

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games:

- Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE).
- The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. **Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.** Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.
- The conversion projects based on ToB: <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy</a> (EET).

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, except total conversion mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/61122-trovador-reo-updated-to-v250-ee-compatible/">report them on the mod forum!</a>

## 

#### Installation Order

>Original game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Trovador REO after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, and EET.
- Please install Trovador REO before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-trovador.exe`__, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __btl__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old save games. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Trovador REO for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: trovador folder and a setup-trovador.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-trovador.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-trovador.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS

Trovador REO for Mac OS is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: trovador folder, setup-trovador and setup-trovador.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-trovador.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-trovador.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Trovador REO for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-trovador`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-trovador --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
